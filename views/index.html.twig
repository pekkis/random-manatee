                <strong>Place a manatee</strong> is a hardcore service for getting pictures of manatees
                for use as placeholders in your designs or code. Just put your image size (width & height) and
                format (jpg) after our URL and you'll get a manatee placeholder.

                <span class="label label-info">Make your life easier!</span>
                Just use <strong>//place.manatee.lc/200/300.jpg</strong> and the manatee placeholder images will
                just work&trade; with both unsecured and secured connections without nagging from the browsers.

                <span class="label label-important">Harness the full power of the manatee!</span>
                You can fine-tune your placeholders and request a specific manatee with the format
                <strong>//place.manatee.lc/x/200/300.jpg</strong> where "x" is the number of your favorite
                <a href="/specimens">specimen(s)</a>. Numbers 1-{{ realManatees|length }} are valid.
            </p>

                <span class="label label-warning">Warning!</span>
                All three species of manatee are listed as vulnerable to extinction. Without our help these noble creatures
                may disappear. <a href="http://savethemanatee.org/">Help save the manatee</a>. We already adopted one
                individual. His name is Vector.

                Manatees goes vector art!
            </h2>

            <p>
                There is now new option to request some hand made vector "manatees" trough this service.
                Requesting vector art is as easy as requesting original photorealistic specimens.
                Only thing that you must change is the format in your URL and you are good to go.

            </p>

            <p>
                You can request a specific manatee with the format
                <strong>//place.manatee.lc/x/200/300.svg</strong> where "x" is the number of your favorite
                <a href="/specimens">specimen(s)</a>. Numbers 1-{{ svgManatees|length }} are valid.

                <span class="label label-important">Content warning!</span>
                Our vector art is bit "different" what you might expect. Our art is practiced by programmers who
                doesn't have any real talent of drawing anything but diagrams.
            </p>

            <p>
                <span class="label label-warning">Warning!</span>
                While our vectorized manatees are not vulnerable to extinction the Vector and rest of his photorealistic
                comrades are. <a href="http://www.savethemanatee.org/aa_mortality_10-13.html">2013 was the deadliest year ever for florida's manatees.</a>
